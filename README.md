# Social-Network-Project

This is a project I made for my Senior Exit Exam utlizing Django and Beautiful-Soup  to create a hub for immigrants. Utlizing the Jaccard's similary algorithm the program "matches" users based on similar attributes like name, sex, and religon. SQL is used for the back-end while Django is used for the front-end.
You'll need Beautiful-Soup, Django, and CrispyForms to run the code.
